MusicFileNamer
==============
When editing the contents of my USB thumb drive that I use for playing music in my car, it's often cumbersome to name the files properly so that the stereo will recognize them. The following rules must be obeyed:
	- the root folder must only contain folders, no files
	- the folder names must be prefixed with a two-digit number followed by a hyphen followed by the folder name
	- the prefix numbers must start at 01
	- the prefix number must be consecutive with no duplicates
	- there must not be any spaces before the prefix or hypen and no spaces between the hyphen and folder name
	- song files contained within the folders follow the same naming conventions as the folders
	
This app is to facilitate making changes, such as adding a song to an existing folder or changing the order of songs in a folder. After the new files have been copied to the thumb drive, open the app and arrange the songs in the order you would like and click "Save". The app will then give the follows the correct number prefix in order to conform with the rules.
