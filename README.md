MusicFileNamer
==============
When editing the contents of my USB thumb drive that I use for playing music in my car, it's often cumbersome to name the files properly so that the stereo will recognize them. The following rules must be obeyed:
	- the root folder must only contain folders, no files
	- the folder names must be prefixed with a two-digit number followed by a hyphen followed by the folder name
	- the prefix numbers must start at 01
	- the prefix number must be consecutive with no duplicates
	- there must not be any spaces before the prefix or hypen and no spaces between the hyphen and folder name
	- song files contained within the folders follow the same naming conventions as the folders
